# PoseEstimation
Pose estimation models

Deep High-Resolution Representation Learning for Human Pose Estimation [HRNet] (CVPRâ€™19)
arXiv:https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09212.pdf
Github:https://github.com/leoxiaobin/deep-high-resolution-net.pytorch

Another popular model, also called OpenPose:
Realtime Multi-Person 2D Pose Estimation using Part Affinity Fields
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08050.pdf
https://github.com/ZheC/Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation

And both models can be found in the last part of this blog.
